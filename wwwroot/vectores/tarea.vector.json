[{"Texto":"UNIVERSIDAD DE SAN MARTIN DE PORRES FACULTAD DE INGENIER\u00CDA Y ARQUITECTURA  ESCUELA PROFESIONAL DE INGENIER\u00CDA DE COMPUTACI\u00D3N Y SISTEMAS           RESUMEN SEMANA 14  INTEGRANTES:  BARRANTES CONTO, FABRICIO GABRIEL   PROFESOR:   RUEDA \u00D1OPO, NORMA ADRIANA   LA MOLINA, PER\u00DA  2025\u2013 I Resumen del grupo N\u00B09 \r\nEn la exposici\u00F3n se aborda de manera profunda y cr\u00EDtica la problem\u00E1tica de la vigilancia masiva en la era digital, destacando tanto los beneficios potenciales como los riesgos asociados a estas pr\u00E1cticas. Se analiza c\u00F3mo los avances tecnol\u00F3gicos, como la inteligencia artificial, el reconocimiento facial, los algoritmos predictivos, las c\u00E1maras inteligentes y la geolocalizaci\u00F3n, han proporcionado a los gobiernos y empresas herramientas poderosas para recopilar, procesar y analizar grandes vol\u00FAmenes de datos personales. Aunque estas tecnolog\u00EDas pueden ser utilizadas para fines leg\u00EDtimos, como la protecci\u00F3n de la seguridad nacional, la prevenci\u00F3n del crimen o la mejora de servicios p\u00FAblicos, tambi\u00E9n generan preocupaciones serias en torno a los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales. Uno de los aspectos centrales del an\u00E1lisis es la tensi\u00F3n \u00E9tica generada por la vigilancia masiva: c\u00F3mo garantizar la protecci\u00F3n de la seguridad sin sacrificar la privacidad y las libertades individuales. Se menciona el caso Snowden 2013, que revel\u00F3 la magnitud de la vigilancia estatal y expuso c\u00F3mo las pr\u00E1cticas de recopilaci\u00F3n de datos, muchas veces sin conocimiento ni consentimiento de los individuos, amenazan el derecho a la privacidad y la libertad de expresi\u00F3n. La existencia de controles insuficientes y la falta de regulaci\u00F3n espec\u00EDfica en tecnolog\u00EDas emergentes contribuyen a la creaci\u00F3n de vac\u00EDos legales que pueden ser explotados para justificar acciones invasivas y, en algunos casos, discriminatorias. El ensayo tambi\u00E9n se\u00F1ala que la vigilancia masiva puede generar un \u201Cefecto pan\u00F3ptico\u201D una sensaci\u00F3n de vigilancia constante que puede afectar la conducta de los ciudadanos, promoviendo comportamientos de autocensura y limitando la libertad individual. Cuando las personas sienten que sus movimientos y decisiones est\u00E1n siendo observados en todo momento, se produce un impacto psicol\u00F3gico que puede socavar los valores democr\u00E1ticos y la confianza en las instituciones. Adem\u00E1s, la afirmaci\u00F3n de que la vigilancia masiva puede convertirse en una herramienta de control social refuerza la preocupaci\u00F3n por el riesgo de que estas pr\u00E1cticas se utilicen para limitar la libertad y reforzar un Estado de vigilancia autoritario. Otra problem\u00E1tica importante que se destaca es el impacto diferencial de la vigilancia en distintos grupos sociales. Las tecnolog\u00EDas, en ocasiones, reproducen sesgos sociales y raciales existentes, afectando desproporcionadamente a comunidades minoritarias o vulnerables. La falta de marcos regulatorios adecuados, combinada con sesgos en los algoritmos y pr\u00E1cticas opacas, puede resultar en discriminaci\u00F3n y exclusi\u00F3n social. La necesidad de normativas espec\u00EDficas para tecnolog\u00EDas como el reconocimiento facial, que respalden la protecci\u00F3n de los derechos de estos grupos, resulta fundamental para evitar estos efectos adversos. El texto tambi\u00E9n hace \u00E9nfasis en los vac\u00EDos legales y en la insuficiencia de la regulaci\u00F3n existente, que muchas veces no avanza en paralelo al desarrollo tecnol\u00F3gico. La rapidez con la que surgen nuevas herramientas no siempre se acompa\u00F1a de una legislaci\u00F3n clara, generando un escenario donde la incertidumbre jur\u00EDdica favorece el uso abusivo y sin control de los datos. La falta de transparencia en la gesti\u00F3n de la informaci\u00F3n, as\u00ED como la existencia \r\nde intereses comerciales, convierten a la vigilancia en una pr\u00E1ctica potencialmente peligrosa para la democracia y los derechos humanos. No obstante, tambi\u00E9n se reconocen ciertos argumentos a favor de la vigilancia masiva, como su papel en la detecci\u00F3n de amenazas y delitos, permitiendo a las autoridades actuar preventivamente y reducir riesgos potenciales. Se sostiene que, si bien la vigilancia puede ser una herramienta \u00FAtil para la protecci\u00F3n ciudadana, su eficacia y legitimidad dependen en gran medida de la existencia de controles adecuados, transparencia en los procesos y mecanismos de rendici\u00F3n de cuentas. La implementaci\u00F3n de marcos \u00E9ticos y normativos s\u00F3lidos, as\u00ED como la participaci\u00F3n ciudadana en la deliberaci\u00F3n sobre estas pr\u00E1cticas, son elementos esenciales para equilibrar la seguridad y la protecci\u00F3n de los derechos. Finalmente, el ensayo aboga por la necesidad de promover una cultura de responsabilidad digital, donde tanto los responsables del dise\u00F1o y uso de las tecnolog\u00EDas como los usuarios sean conscientes de las implicaciones \u00E9ticas, sociales y legales. Es indispensable fortalecer las instituciones democr\u00E1ticas, fomentar la educaci\u00F3n en derechos digitales y promover pol\u00EDticas p\u00FAblicas que aseguren la protecci\u00F3n de la privacidad y los derechos fundamentales en un contexto cada vez m\u00E1s marcado por la tecnolog\u00EDa.
